                        Have you been stressing about trying to put pencil to paper to design your next great exhibit hall? Figuring out how many different-sized booths you can add to your exhibit hall can be time-consuming. Consequently, have you discovered how many of each booth option can fit within your venue? Attempting to design an exhibit hall floor plan can be a complicated puzzle. Today, expo management and floor plan software can prevent you from executing your assets manually. Below, weâ€™ll help you kick off your event logistics by providing tips on how to design your exhibitor floor plan.

                        When do you start designing your floor plan?

                        Before selling sponsorship packages, you must know how many booths you can offer and their price points. During your brainstorming stage, review how many exhibitor packages you sold at your last show. After completing an event, consider sending out a post-show survey. Thus, you can ask your previous exhibitors if they plan on returning and if they are looking to purchase a bigger booth than at your last event. In addition, you can request any additional features you can add to encourage them to resign.

                        Once you have collected the results from your survey, estimate how many attendees and exhibitors you will expect to host at your next event. As a result, this will help you decide on your venue space. After registration slows down, establish your newly estimated attendee and exhibitor count. Therefore, if you need a smaller or larger room, you can adjust your rented space before getting too far in your layout process.
